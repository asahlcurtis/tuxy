    <h2>Philosophy of tuxy:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Tuxy is a virtual assistant, but a virtual assistant with a lot of upcoming features. Tuxy is also very easy to customize. Tuxy is built to be edited, it loads things like assistants so you can add your own assistant images, It has plenty of comments and documentation to easily learn how it works like the back of your hand. Tuxy also introduces libraries like lib/node.h which is a header file that creates a dragable object, and this isn't the only custom object tuxy will create, I plan to make many different classes to add functionality for the software, and since tuxy is MIT licensed you can use these header files, even commericaly.</p>
